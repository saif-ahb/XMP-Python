# XMP-Metadata
Extracts tags from filename and inserts them as XMP metadata


A rudementary script to improve file sorting/grouping. Meant to work in conjuction with [PixivBatchDownloader](https://github.com/xuejianxianzun/PixivBatchDownloader)'s download naming rule. But can function with anything as long as the tags are in the filename and are delimited.

This again; is a basic script that served as a short project to get back into python (and programming as a whole). Feedback is of course appreciated.
