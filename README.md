# XMP-Script
Extracts tags from filename and inserts them as XMP metadata


A rudementary script to improve file sorting/grouping. Meant to work in conjuction with [PixivBatchDownloader](https://github.com/xuejianxianzun/PixivBatchDownloader)'s download naming rule. But can function with anything as long as the tags are in the filename and are delimited.

This again; is a basic script that served as a short project to get back into python (and programming as a whole). Feedback is of course appreciated.


Installation
------------
Works automatically, add in your target folder, exiftool path, delimiter if may be, and it *should* do everything on its own. Might make it more verbose and more interactive in the future, this is my first actual python script.
